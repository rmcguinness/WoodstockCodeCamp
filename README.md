# Woodstock Code Camp

Welcome, this is the team project for the Woodstock code camp. Here we will create a Single Page Web Application
using HTML, CSS, React, GitHub, Git, and Visual Studio Code.

The project will last aproximatly two weeks in which time the team will employ the agile methodology to develop
a simple calculator application with a help and about page. The team will learn how to employ Git best practices
for working on a team while learning to self organize and bring projects to others.
